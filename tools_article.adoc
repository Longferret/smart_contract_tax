[[overlooked_area]]
=== Overlooked area and possible contribution

The reetrancy vulnerability is often detected by analysis tools but other vulnerabilities like coding logic, sanity checks or on-chain oracle manipulation are not currently detected by automatic analysis tool.
Same with protocol-layer vulnerabilities.

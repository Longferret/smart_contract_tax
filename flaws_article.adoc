[[vulnerable_contracts]]
=== Collection of vulnerable contract
In addtion to parsing the blockchain and get the data in bytecode, I post here collections done of known vulnerable smart contracts in solidity and/or bytecode.

143 vulnerable smart contracts (+fix)::
https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-curated/tree/main/dataset

12 vulnerable smart contracts (+fix)::
https://github.com/crytic/not-so-smart-contracts

Collection of 186 397 smart contracts that have a least one transaction (1st of April 2022):: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/verified-smart-contracts

609 vulnerable smart contracts::
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Vulnerable_Verified_Smart_Contracts/21990287

from the article: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10601.pdf

The article propose a transformer-based large language model to detect vulnerable code and propose solutions.


[[overlooked_area]]
=== Overlooked area and possible contribution
I remark that collection of vulnerable smart contract are hard to find, creating a database filled with smart contracts and their potential fix could be interresting.

Example: Getting all (active?) smart contract on the ethereum blockchain, try to find vulnerabilities with bytecode signature or an analysis tool and finally recover solidity code from etherscan.

The different taxonomies of vulnerabilities are all differents and subjectives, it is hard to propose or see change that could be done.

The lack of good practice guide, tutorials are everywhere but there are few advanced tutorials to code advanced feature in solidity.

Example: Code a dApp feature (like a DAO,..) and show potiential vulnerabilities and how to avoid them

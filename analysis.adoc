= Analysis of recently deployed smart contracts
This section contains how I ran analysis different tools on recently deployed smart contracts.

[[slither]]
== Slither
The first experiment is testing smart contracts with the slither analysis tool.

https://github.com/crytic/slither

It is used to detect vulnerabilities given a solidity or vyper source code.

[[methodology]]
=== Methodology

I used this command line on each contract that I gathered:

_slither {contract_addr} --etherscan-only-source-code --etherscan-apikey ETHERSCAN KEY --json slither.txt --json-types detectors --exclude-optimization --exclude-informational --exclude-dependencies --exclude-low_

What it does:

* check for etherscan source code

* export result as a JSON in a txt file

* exclude optimization, informationnal, dependencies warnings and low impact vulnerabilities

Next step is classification of the vulnerabilities and analysis.
